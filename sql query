-- *The following query has been used for the test statistics

Write a SQL query that returns: the user ID, the user’s country, the user’s gender, the user’s device type, the user’s test group,
whether or not they converted (spent > $0), and how much they spent in total ($0+). 

A.
SELECT distinct g.uid as userid,COALESCE(u.country,'notknown') as country,COALESCE(u.gender,'notknown') as gender,
